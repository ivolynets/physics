# Basic Physics Calculations

The project contains [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) notebooks with calclations for certain basic physics phenomena:

* Ballistics

## Environment Conviguration

The project requires [Python](https://www.python.org) to be installed on the host. It runs in the dedicated [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). In order to activate the environment and start the Jupyter user interface, execute the following command in the terminal:

```shell
$ source activate
```

If the environment is not initialized yet, this script will try to initialize it first by running the special script which installs all needed dependencies. The initialization script can also be run manually by the command:

```shell
$ source init
```

The Jupyter service can be shutdown by the shortcut `Ctrl+C`. To deactivate the virtual environment execute the following command in the terminal:

```shell
$ deactivate
```
